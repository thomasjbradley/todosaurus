## Why?

I’ve struggled to find a todo app that worked for me. Many are too complicated. Many are too closed. Many aren’t keyboard driven enough. Many don’t match my design sensibilities.

So, I recently really went digging to find something that I would enjoy using. The closest I found was the Todo.txt format used in the command line. But for me the command line doesn’t provide the right context in my brain for handling my todo list. I tried a couple of the Todo.txt GUI apps listed on the website, but their key bindings weren’t intuitive to me.

So, I made my own.
